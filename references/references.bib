               assess the influence of cognitive loss on the ability to conduct
               everyday activities and represent the ``ultimate test'' of
               efficacy for antidementia drug trials. They provide information
               about clinically meaningful function and behavior and are less
               affected by the ``floor'' and ``ceiling'' effects commonly
               associated with psychometric tests. The Washington University
               Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a global scale developed to
               clinically denote the presence of DAT and stage its severity. The
               clinical protocol incorporates semistructured interviews with the
               patient and informant to obtain information necessary to rate the
               subject's cognitive performance in six domains: memory,
               orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs,
               home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR has been
               standardized for multicenter use, including the Consortium to
               Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and the
               Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, and interrater reliability
               has been established. Criterion validity for both the global CDR
               and scores on individual domains has been demonstrated, and the
               CDR also has been validated neuropathologically, particularly for
               the presence or absence of dementia. Standardized training
               protocols are available. Although not well suited as a brief
               screening tool for population surveys of dementia because the
               protocol depends on sufficient time to conduct interviews, the
               CDR has become widely accepted in the clinical setting as a
               reliable and valid global assessment measure for DAT.",
