               assess the influence of cognitive loss on the ability to conduct
               everyday activities and represent the ``ultimate test'' of
               efficacy for antidementia drug trials. They provide information
               about clinically meaningful function and behavior and are less
               affected by the ``floor'' and ``ceiling'' effects commonly
               associated with psychometric tests. The Washington University
               Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a global scale developed to
               clinically denote the presence of DAT and stage its severity. The
               clinical protocol incorporates semistructured interviews with the
               patient and informant to obtain information necessary to rate the
               subject's cognitive performance in six domains: memory,
               orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs,
               home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR has been
               standardized for multicenter use, including the Consortium to
               Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and the
               Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, and interrater reliability
               has been established. Criterion validity for both the global CDR
               and scores on individual domains has been demonstrated, and the
               CDR also has been validated neuropathologically, particularly for
               the presence or absence of dementia. Standardized training
               protocols are available. Although not well suited as a brief
               screening tool for population surveys of dementia because the
               protocol depends on sufficient time to conduct interviews, the
               CDR has become widely accepted in the clinical setting as a
               reliable and valid global assessment measure for DAT.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a clinical syndrome resulting from a
              number of causations and which is usually accompanied by
              progressive and diffuse brain dysfunction. The different subtypes
              are characterised by a clinical picture with common symptoms that
              differ in terms of their aetiology, age, clinical presentation,
              clinical course and associated disorders. AIM: To present an
              update on the information available about the descriptive
              epidemiology of dementia and its main subtypes. DEVELOPMENT: The
              main data on prevalence, incidence and mortality were extracted
              from a literature review. Alzheimer's disease is the most
              frequent subtype and accounts for 60-80\% of all the cases,
              followed by vascular dementia and other neurodegenerative
              dementias, such as dementia due to Lewy bodies, the
              dementia-Parkinson complex and frontotemporal dementia. Other
              subtypes of dementias present frequencies below 1\%, and the
              epidemiological indicators available are not very robust.
              CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence of dementia increase
              exponentially from the age of 65 onwards. As a consequence of the
              progressive ageing of the population and the increase in life
              expectancy, the number of cases of dementia will rise in the
              coming decades. Recent studies point to a slight drop in the
              accumulated risk of dementia adjusted by age groups and sex over
              the last few decades in some countries. It is possible that by
              means of primary prevention strategies implemented upon the known
              risk factors for dementia the burden of dementia on public health
              will diminish in the future.",

              though different methodologies have made these findings difficult
              to interpret. We examined imaging data from a large cohort
              (N=194) of mixed dementia patients and controls, 65years old and
              older from the Cache County, Utah Study of Memory and Aging for
              evidence of the brain reserve hypothesis using total intracranial
              volume (TICV) as a quantitative measure of pre-morbid brain size
              and a vicarious indicator of reserve. A broader spectrum of
              non-demented elderly control subjects from previous studies was
              also included for comparison (N=423). In addition, non-parametric
              Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses were performed
              to model group heterogeneity and identify any subgroups of
              patients where TICV might be an important predictor of dementia.
              Parametrically, no main effect was found for TICV when predicting
              a dementia diagnosis; however, the CART analysis did reveal
              important TICV subgroups, including a sex differential wherein
              $\epsilon$4 APOE allele presence in males and low TICV predicted
              AD classification. TICV, APOE, and other potential
              mediator/moderator variables are discussed in the context of the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment
              syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were
              estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild
              cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others
              remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest
              in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The
              Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the
              most often used short screening tool for providing an overall
              measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and
              community settings. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic
              accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting
              individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to
              dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms
              of dementia at follow-up. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS
              (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register
              of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014);
              MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May
              2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of
              Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings
              Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014);
              PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME)
              (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of
              diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in
              May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven,
              www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
              Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health
              Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and
              ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No
              language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic
              searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to
              restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We
              also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews,
              tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used
              searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related
              articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE
              for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but
              unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered longitudinal
              studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI
              participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard
              was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants
              recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under
              Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a
              Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly
              used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's
              dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and
              frontotemporal dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We
              screened all titles generated by the electronic database
              searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts
              of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified
              full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by
              two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two
              authors independently performed quality assessment using the
              QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we
              derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity
              from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver
              operating characteristic curve. MAIN RESULTS: In this review, we
              included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI
              patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies
              assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion
              from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this
              test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only
              one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from
              MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in
              general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from
              sensitivities of 23\% to 76\% and specificities from 40\% to
              94\%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's
              disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged
              from sensitivities of 27\% to 89\% and specificities from 32\% to
              90\%. Only one study provided information about conversion from
              MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36\% and a
              specificity of 80\% with an incidence of vascular dementia of
              6.2\%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of
              heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of
              studies included in our analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our
              review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of
              MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the
              identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia.
              Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests
              to be sure about the management of these patients. An important
              aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia
              from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over
              time instead of single measurements. It is also important to
              assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be
              more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia.",
